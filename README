Zippy Zipper - ZpyZpr - zz (zzg, zzb) - A multi-process/threaded compression utility

Zippy Zipper makes use of the design features of gzip and bzip2 that allow many
compressed pieces of a source file to be concatenated together and result in a valid
compressed file. ZpyZpr relies only on the zlib and bz2 modules for the compression
logic. ZpyZpr falls back to the threading module which may or may not distribute
over your cores/cpus. To avoid limitations from threading ZpyZpr can use the
multiprocessing module available in Python >= 2.6, failing that it will use the
processing module (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/processing) on Python <= 2.5. Using
the processing modules causes ZpyZpr to spawn multiple Python processes which allow
the operating system to distribute the load over your cores/cpus.
